A game made by an AI?

If a current AI (LLM) made a game for the Commodore VIC-20 computer, what would it be like?

Is any current (free) AI capable of making a game for the VIC-20?

Here is the answer:

I asked some AIs to create a game for the VIC-20, here is the initial prompt:

"Create a game for the Commodore VIC-20 computer."

That's it. Without giving any details of what the game should be like, leaving everything to the AI ​​to decide.

Initially all the tested models failed:

- DeepSeek R1
- ChatGPT
- Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Qwen2.5 Max
  
However, everyone was given the chance to correct what was wrong in the code they suggested and then one of the models managed to create a functional game:
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet
  
The game is simple and slow, but it has all the basic characteristics of a game. So here is the game that was created by a current AI, leaving it free to define all the features of the game.
