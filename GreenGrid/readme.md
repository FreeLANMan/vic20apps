Known bugs/limitations:
- A bit slow.
- Saves only 1 job. To save multiple files, the user needs to manually change the file names.
- If the user moves the cursor too quickly, unwanted characters may appear along the way.
- There is no blinking cursor where there is a space character. If you want it to flash, use the '0' key.
