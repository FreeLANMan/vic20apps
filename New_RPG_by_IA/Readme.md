# An RPG game made by an AI


Can a current AI create an RPG game from scratch?

The answer is yes!
I asked some current AIs to create an RPG game for the VIC-20 computer. Once again, the AI ​​that did the best was 'Claude 3.7 Sonnet'.

Here is the prompt:

"Make a text-based role-playing game for the VIC-20 computer."

That's it. Without giving any more details about how the game should be, everything being decided by the AI.

The game is extremely simple but functional. I complained that the game was too easy and the AI ​​made a hard version too.

## What you need:
1. A Commodore VIC-20 computer (or emulator) with 8Kb expansion. I haven't tested on real hardware, only on emulators.
