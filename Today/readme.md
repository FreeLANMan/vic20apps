# VIC Today

Find out which most important historical event occurred on each date using your computer (or emulator) Commodore VIC-20.

How can I read the news on the VIC-20 if my VIC-20 emulator does not have access to the Internet or any other similar network?

Simply impossible. But part of what is news is the memory of important historical events (or new acts inspired by such historical events), birthdays, commemorative dates and recurring astronomical events. This part of what is news is indeed possible to read on a disconnected VIC-20. That is why this 'app' was created.
