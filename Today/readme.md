# VIC Today

Find out which most important historical event occurred on each date using your computer (or emulator) Commodore VIC-20.

## The problem:
How can I read the news on the VIC-20 if my VIC-20 emulator does not have access to the Internet or any other similar network?

Simply impossible. But part of what is news is the memory of important historical events (or new acts inspired by such historical events), birthdays, commemorative dates and recurring astronomical events. This part of what is news is indeed possible to read on a disconnected VIC-20. That is why this 'app' was created.

## What you need:
1. A Commodore VIC-20 computer (or emulator) with 35Kb expansion (or less maybe). I haven't tested on real hardware, only on emulators.

## How to use:
1. Load the program.

After loading you will get a '?SYNTAX ERROR IN 10'. Don't worry, this just means that you loaded the code and the interpreter didn't recognize what is written on line 10 as valid code. But in this case it is part of the plan.

2. type 'list MMDD' and press ENTER (or RETURN). MM is the month and DD is the day.

For example: 'list 0415' + ENTER key to find out the most important event of the 15th of April. 

You can also use 'list MMDD-MMDD' to view 2 to 4 events at a time, for example 'list 0415-0419' + ENTER, which will return the most important events for 4/15, 4/16, 4/17, 4/18 and 4/19.

Most of the information was generated by AIs (LLMs) and was not checked, so it is possible to find errors (I even found errors on Wikipedia pages when I was making this list, so errors in dates are widespread), so always check an external source if it is important information.

Birth/birthday events, commemorative dates, and events related to Brazil were excluded as I intend to make specific lists for them.
